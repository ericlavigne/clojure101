In this exerise you will implement the "Deaf Grandma" program as seen in Chris Pine's book "Learn to Program": 
write a program that let's you talk to your virtual grandmother. Whatever you say (type), Granny will respond 
with "HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!", unless you shout (type in all capitals). If you shout, she'll hear you (or at
least pretend to) and yell back "NO, NOT SINCE <random year between 1930 and 1950>!". Your conversation with
granny ends once you shout "BYE".

Feel free to experiment with everything we have learned in this chapter to structure your program. Once you are
satisfied with your solution, modify it so you have to shout "BYE" three times in a row until granny finally
let's you go ("BYEBYEBYE" or "BYE BYE BYE" do not count).
