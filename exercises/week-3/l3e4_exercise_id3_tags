Write a Clojure program to pretty print ID3v1 Tags (we won't bother with v2 for this exercise). An ID3v1 tag is a
128-byte data structure at the end of an MP3 file. These 128 bytes are literally packed with information about the 
song: name, artist, album name, and so on. You can parse this data structure by opening an MP3 file and doing a 
series of reads from a position near the end of the file. According to the ID3 standard, if you start from the 
128th-to-last byte of an MP3 file and read three bytes, you should get the string "TAG". If you don't, there's no ID3 
tag for this MP3 file, and nothing to do. If there is an ID3 tag present, then the 30 bytes after TAG contain the 
name of the song, the 30 bytes after that contain the name of the artist, and so on. 

Write a program to parse the ID3v1 tags and include a function to pretty-print them like this: 

user=> (pp-tags [:song :artist :album :year])
ID3v1 Tags for song.mp3
==================================================
      Song: Dancing Shoes
    Artist: Cliff Richard and The Shadows
     Album: (SUMMER HOLIDAY  1963)
      Year: 2000

You are free to use everything we have learned so far in this course. A sample song.mp3 file is available to 
test your program.
