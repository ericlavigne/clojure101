Querying booksets
=================

In this exercise, we will be querying the collection of books
maintained by our personal library app from weeks 1 & 2.

For starters, please write code to accomplish the following:

 1. obtain a collection of books authored by a particular individual;

 2. obtain a count of all books authored by more than one person.

How would you go about discovering whether there is a person having at
least 3 overdue items on loan from your library (and if so, then who
might it be)?
