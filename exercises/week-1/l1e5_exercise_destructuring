Destructuring
=============

For this exercise, you will be modifying the file 'book_list.clj'.  This is a
simple Clojure program that prints the top ten Amazon best-selling books on 16
March 2010.  Do not worry about any forms you do not understad, you will only be
modifying the print-book function.


1.1 Destructuring a map
-----------------------

Note how the author, title, and price are accessed by using the book map as a
function.  This function would be more concise if the book argument were
destructured into corresponding symbols.  Rewrite print-book as follows with
the appropriate destructuring.

(defn print-book
  "Prints out information about a book."
  [ {var-name :key-name, ... } ]                ; <- add destructuring here
  (println "Title:" title)
  (println "  Author: " (comma-sep authors))
  (println "  Price:" (money-str price)))


1.2 Destructuring a map using :keys
-----------------------------------

Now refine the print-book function to use the ':keys' method to destructure the
map.


2.1 Destructuring a vector
--------------------------

The requirements have changed, and now any book with three or more authors
needs to be printed out as 'First Author, Second Author, et. al.'  Modify
print-book as follows and destructure the authors vector.

(defn print-book
  "Prints out information about a book."
  [{:keys ... }]                                ; <- contains destructuring from 1.2
  (println "Title:" title)
  (let [... authors]                            ; <- add destructuring of authors here
    (println "  Author:" (comma-sep
                           (filter seq [first
                                        second
                                        (when more "et. al.")]))))
  (println "  Price:" (money-str price)))


2.2 Destructuring with :as
--------------------------

The requirements change yet againâ€”now the print-book function must output a
Clojure reader-compatible representation of the book map as 'Raw'.  Use ':as'
in your destructuring to capture the entire function argument as 'book' in the
revised function below:


(defn print-book
  "Prints out information about a book."
  [{:keys ... }]                                ; <- contains destructuring from 1.2
  (println "Title:" title)
  (let [... authors]                            ; <- contains destructuring from 2.1
    (println "  Author:" (comma-sep
                           (filter seq [first
                                        second
                                        (when more "et. al.")]))))
  (println "  Price:" (money-str price))
  (println "  Raw:" (pr-str book)))
