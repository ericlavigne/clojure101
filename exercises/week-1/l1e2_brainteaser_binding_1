Look at the following Clojure code and try to guess the value of "y" inside
the 'let' and 'binding' forms. Once you are done use the REPL to verify your
answers.

(def x 1)
(def y 1)
(let [x 5 y x] y)     ; 5
(binding [x 5 y x] y) ; 5

; Guess: Both expressions yield 5.
; The values of both x and y are shadowed by new bindings (x=y=5).
; No difference between lexical (let) and dynamic (binding) scoping 
; because there are no function calls involved.

; Verify in REPL: I was wrong about the second expression - 1 instead of 5.
; The bindings are sequential in let but parallel in binding, so y is bound 
; to the old value of x: 1
