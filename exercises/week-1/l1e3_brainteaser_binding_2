Looking at the following snippet, can you predict the output of both
binding forms? Use the REPL to check your answers.

(defn method-one [& args] (apply println "Inside method #1 =>" args))
(defn method-two [& args] (apply println "Inside method #2 =>" args))

(binding [method-one method-two]
  (method-one 1 2 3))

((binding [method-one method-two]
   #(method-one 1 2 3)))
