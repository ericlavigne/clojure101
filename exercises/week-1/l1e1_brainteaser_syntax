Look at the following REPL transcript and make sure you understand the
difference between the two forms. Why does the first one raise an exception
and what does the error message mean?

user=> (1 2 3)
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)
user=> '(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)

; An unquoted list is evaluated by treating the first element as an operator and the rest as arguments.
; The operator is either a macro or, more commonly, a function (clojure.lang.IFn).
; The number 1 (java.lang.Integer) can not be treated as either.
