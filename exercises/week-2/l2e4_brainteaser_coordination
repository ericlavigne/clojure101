Suppose that you have two Refs:

    (def x (ref 1))
    (def y (ref 1))

Depending on some circumstance or other, you might want to increase
the value of either one; however, the sum is never to exceed 3.
Here's a function you might use in a transaction to see whether its ok
to increase one of them:

    (defn ok-to-inc? [x y]
      (< (+ x y) 3))

And here is a piece of code which will exercise the above:

    (future
     (dosync
      (let [xv @x
            yv @y]
        (if (ok-to-inc? xv yv)
          (alter x inc)))))

    (future
     (dosync
      (let [xv @x
            yv @y]
        (if (ok-to-inc? xv yv)
          (alter y inc)))))

Do you see the problem with this code?  Can you modify it slightly to
force the problem to exhibit itself?  How would you go about
correcting it?
