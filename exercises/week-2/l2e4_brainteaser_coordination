Suppose that you have two Refs:

    (def x (ref 1))
    (def y (ref 1))

Depending on some circumstance or other, you might want to increase
the value of either one; however, the sum is never to exceed 3.
Here's a function you might use in a transaction to see whether it is
ok to increase one of them:

    (defn ok-to-inc? [x y]
      (< (+ x y) 3))

And here is a piece of code which will exercise the above:

    (do

      (future
       (dosync
        (let [xv @x
              yv @y]
          ;; let's take a 1 second nap...
          (Thread/sleep 1000)
          (if (ok-to-inc? xv yv)
            (alter x inc)))))
  
      (future
       (dosync
        (let [xv @x
              yv @y]
          (Thread/sleep 1000)
          (if (ok-to-inc? xv yv)
            (alter y inc))))))

Do you see the problem with this code?  How would you go about
correcting it?
