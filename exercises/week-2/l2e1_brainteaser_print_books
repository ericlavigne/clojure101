Remember the print-book function you refined to perfection last week,
then used to print out the information on several books?  Now, it would
be nice to be able to use it to print information on some books with
a short summary -- a count perhaps -- added at the end.  Here's an
attempt at writing a function to accomplish that:

(defn print-books [& books]
  (map print-book books)
  (print   "\n=============\n")
  (println "Printed information on"
           (count books)
           "books."))

Do you see any problems with this code?
