In experimenting with complicated transaction patterns, it might be
useful to write a one-off function to reset all Refs involved to some
useful initial state.  An attempt at writing such a function could
look as follows:

    (defn reset-stuff []
      (dosync
       (map ref-set
            [x y z] ; could pass in some arguments, of course
            [1 2 3])))

Assuming that the symbols 'x, 'y and 'z all resolve to Refs in the
current namespace, what do you think would happen after a call to
reset-stuff?
